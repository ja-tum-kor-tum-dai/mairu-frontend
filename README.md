# Mairu Frontend

Mairu (from Thai word "ไม่รู้")

This repository is the frontend of the Mairu application, the application that can answer any questions with the answer is "ไม่รู้" (meaning as the same "don't know").
We created it for fun and in short times during the [Stupid Hackathon Thailand #5](https://stupidhackth.github.io/5/) event.

Mairu frontend is built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework.
